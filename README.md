> This is a bad attempt at porting UBlock Origin to Manifest V3 to stop Google from removing adblockers from Chrome. I will only update the Manifest according to [Google's instuctions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate) and this is NO WAY affiliated with the **original** UBlock Origin.
